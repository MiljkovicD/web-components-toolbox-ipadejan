# Grid Components

This project includes two grid components, one being the grid gallery and the other being the grid tile.
## Description
I have built two components that should be included in our toolbox. The Grid Gallery is a component that represents an image gallery. The image is displayed in mosaic form. When you click on the image, a modal opens displaying the image in an enlarged view. The Grid Tiles were designed to present information in a clear and organized manner. They display photos, text, and links.
### How to use this?
You will find the component in the web-components-toolbox after the IPA expires. However, at the moment, the component will only be available in this project.
